# Design Patterns – Head First Approach

This repository is a practical learning journey through software design patterns,
inspired by the book **Head First Design Patterns**.

Instead of jumping directly to pattern implementations, each pattern is explored
by first identifying a real design problem, applying a naive solution, and then
refactoring the code using the appropriate design pattern.

The goal is to understand **why** a pattern is needed, not just **how** to implement it.
